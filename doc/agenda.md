* Current pain points
  * Devs just handle the errors on their own, no consistency, lots of contradictions
  * They generate lots of code
  * Devs are confused
  * Developers just apply patches
* Note on not treating this as a tech debt
* Symptoms (on example):
  * mixing domains
  * handling locally and not globally 
  * lack of standard â†’ inconsistencies, each dev is on their own 
  * too much code, 
  * too much 
  * whacky system behavior from API perspective
  * limited information in logs for troubleshooting
  * lack of any flexibility
  * hardcoded messages
* How the framework works (highlight principles)
* Show examples of use from the dev perspecitive
* How the messages are composed to various audiences
* How the configuration works
* Where the messages can be templetized
* Benefits of message ID
* How quickly this framework can be implemented - 1week
