# “Technical Debt“ is a Bad Analogy

> This article is under editing process (unfinished)


The error handling in code is a part of the software developer’s life which is pushed into back of any work that is done. 
Proper reporting errors and any other noteworthy situations is usually left to be resolved at the end of the development cycle. 
Unfortunately, then when most of the code is done it is too late to make considerable changes in this matter because the code tends to get solidified as lava block. 
This makes any later changes almost impossible to be done.


One of the practice prevalent in the software development world especially in te domain of management is that proper error handling and solving that problem is a sort of a debt that can be payed later after the core functionality was delivered. 
The idea is that when starting construction of the new software we do not care much  on resolving certain technical nuances we encounter but focus on the delivery of the main function, albeit faulty. 
Later it can be resolved and the “debt” can be payed.  
The error of this picture is that the assumption that the “debt” is not affecting the quality of work and speed or cost of delivery of the main functionality. 
It is like the clean check from the bank to speedup construction of the new house. While in case of the financing the house it is really good ro at least working idea, this analogy is incorrect and harmful when applied for the software industry. 
And let me explain why.
